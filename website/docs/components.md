Ionic apps are made of high-level building blocks called Components, which allow you to quickly construct the UI for your app. Ionic comes stock with a number of components, including cards, lists, and tabs. Once youâ€™re familiar with the basics, refer to the [API Index](api.md) for a complete list of each component and sub-component.
