# What is Echo UI

## Description

## Why Echo UI ?

Nowadays, [Web Audio API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Audio_API) has become a very popular and mature technology for web audio development, and libraries based on it (such as [tone.js](https://github.com/Tonejs/Tone.js) and [howler.js](https://github.com/goldfire/howler.js)) have emerged and become very popular. However, the interaction interface for audio operations is cumbersome and involves many technical points, so this can be a major stumbling block to the development of this technology.

**Echo UI** aims to simplify the development process of audio interaction pages, reduce the burden on the developer's mind, and allow users to use out-of-the-box component libraries to quickly build an elegant audio interaction application!
