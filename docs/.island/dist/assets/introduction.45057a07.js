Echo UI is currently in the development phase of core functionality, the API is subject to change, feel free to raise [issue](https://github.com/codeacme17/echo-ui/issues) or [PR](https://github.com/codeacme17/echo-ui/pulls)\r
\r
Once the core functionality has been developed, NPM will be uploaded and you can install Echo UI via \`npm install echo-ui\`.\r

## Why echo-ui?\r
\r
**Echo UI** is a UI library designed specifically for the [Web Audio API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Audio_API). Its goal is to make it easier for engineers to develop browser audio applications. It offers the following key features:\r
\r
- **Out-of-the-Box**: Echo UI provides a set of out-of-the-box components that you can directly use to build your audio applications, such as an EQ equalizer, an audio player, or a VST plugin.\r
\r
- **Customizable & Easily Extendable**: Developed based on [React](https://react.dev/) and [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), it allows you to easily customize the style and interaction behavior of components. Additionally, you can easily extend Echo UI's component library.\r
\r
- **Easy-to-use Hook**: Hook specially designed for audio interaction and analysis applications, which can easily implement audio interactive applications.\r
\r
- **High-Quality Interactions**: Many of the component interactions are inspired by high-quality DAW (Digital Audio Workstation) applications like [Ableton Live](https://www.ableton.com/en/live/) and [FL Studio](https://www.image-line.com/). These interactions greatly enhance the user experience.\r
\r
- **Responsive Layout**: Echo UI's component library is responsive, meaning they can automatically adapt to different screen sizes, providing a good experience on different devices.\r
\r
## Disclaimer\r
\r
The component library of **Echo UI** is not a complete web application framework. It does not include components like forms or lists. The APIs exposed by components such as buttons and input fields are designed for audio application interactions. You are encouraged to use it in conjunction with other more comprehensive UI component libraries (recommended: [NextUI](https://nextui.org/docs/guide/introduction), [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/)).\r
