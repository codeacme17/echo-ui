## About component

The component library of **Echo UI** is not a complete web application components library. It does not include components like forms or lists. The APIs exposed by components such as buttons and input fields are designed for audio application interactions. You are encouraged to use it in conjunction with other more comprehensive UI component libraries (recommended: [NextUI](https://nextui.org/docs/guide/introduction), [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/)).

## About Hook

Most of the Hooks in Echo UI are encapsulated based on Tone.js, so before using Hooks, it will be better to read [Tone.js documentation](https://tonejs.github.io/) Development efficiency. Of course, in the process of building and using components, you can also use any API library or native Web Audio API
