## About component

The component library of **Echo UI** is not a complete web application components library. It does not include components like forms or lists. The APIs exposed by components such as buttons and input fields are designed for audio application interactions. You are encouraged to use it in conjunction with other more comprehensive UI component libraries (recommended: [NextUI](https://nextui.org/docs/guide/introduction), [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/)).

## About Hook

Most of the Hooks in Echo UI are encapsulated based on Tone.js, so before using Hooks, it will be better to read [Tone.js documentation](https://tonejs.github.io/) Development efficiency. Of course, in the process of building and using components, you can also use any API library or native Web Audio API

## About this documentation website

This documentation website is built using [island.js](https://github.com/sanyuan0704/island.js). I am very grateful to [sanyuan0704](https://github.com/sanyuan0704) and many outstanding contributors. Open source work provides an excellent document website solution for the React ecosystem. However, during my development process, some problems may have occurred due to some configuration reasons. I may rewrite the entire documentation website in the future, or I may not. If you have any suggestions or ideas, please submit them in [issue](https://github.com/codeacme17/echo-ui/issues)
