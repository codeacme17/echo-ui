# Introduction

:::info{title=""}

Echo UI is currently in the development stage of its core features. We warmly welcome partners interested in this type of component library to join us. We also appreciate any valuable suggestions submitted through [issue](https://github.com/codeacme17/echo-ui/issues)

Once the core functionality is developed, it will be available on NPM, and then Echo UI can be installed using tools like `npm`.

For more development plans, check out [Roadmap](https://github.com/codeacme17/echo-ui/blob/main/ROADMAP.md).

## Why Echo UI?

Nowadays, [Web Audio API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Audio_API) has become a very popular and mature technology for web audio development, and libraries based on it (such as [tone.js](https://github.com/Tonejs/Tone.js) and [howler.js](https://github.com/goldfire/howler.js)) have emerged and become very popular. However, the interaction interface for audio operations is cumbersome and involves many technical points, so this can be a major stumbling block to the development of this technology.

**Echo UI** aims to simplify the development process of audio interaction pages, reduce the burden on the developer's mind, and allow users to use out-of-the-box component libraries to quickly build an elegant audio interaction application!

## Features

- **Out-of-the-Box**: Echo UI provides a set of out-of-the-box components that you can directly use to build your audio applications, such as an EQ equalizer, an audio player, or a VST plugin.

- **High-Quality Interactions**: Many of the component interactions are inspired by high-quality DAW (Digital Audio Workstation) applications like [Ableton Live](https://www.ableton.com/en/live/) and [FL Studio](https://www.image-line.com/). These interactions greatly enhance the user experience.

- **Customizable & Easily Extendable**: Developed based on [React](https://react.dev/) and [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), it allows you to easily customize the style and interaction behavior of components. Additionally, you can easily extend Echo UI's component library.

- **Easy-to-use Hook**: Hook specially designed for audio interaction and analysis applications, which can easily implement audio interactive applications.

- **Responsive Layout**: Echo UI's component library is responsive, meaning they can automatically adapt to different screen sizes, providing a good experience on different devices.

## Disclaimer

The component library of **Echo UI** is not a complete web application framework. It does not include components like forms or lists. The APIs exposed by components such as buttons and input fields are designed for audio application interactions. You are encouraged to use it in conjunction with other more comprehensive UI component libraries (recommended: [NextUI](https://nextui.org/docs/guide/introduction), [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/)).
