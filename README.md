## Why Echo UI ?

Nowadays, [Web Audio API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Audio_API) has become a very popular and mature technology for web audio development, and libraries based on it (such as [tone.js](https://github.com/Tonejs/Tone.js) and [howler.js](https://github.com/goldfire/howler.js)) have emerged and become very popular. However, the interaction interface for audio operations is cumbersome and involves many technical points, so this can be a major stumbling block to the development of this technology.

**Echo UI** aims to simplify the development process of audio interaction pages, reduce the burden on the developer's mind, and allow users to use out-of-the-box component libraries to quickly build an elegant audio interaction application!

## Features

#### üì¶ **Out-of-the-Box**

Echo UI provides a set of out-of-the-box components that you can directly use to build your audio applications, such as an EQ equalizer, an audio player, or a VST plugin.

#### üéõÔ∏è **High-Quality Interactions**

Many of the component interactions are inspired by high-quality DAW (Digital Audio Workstation) applications like [Ableton Live](https://www.ableton.com/en/live/) and [FL Studio](https://www.image-line.com/). These interactions greatly enhance the user experience.

#### ‚ú® **Customizable & Easily Extensible**

Developed based on [React](https://react.dev/) and [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), it allows you to easily customize the style and interaction behavior of components. Additionally, you can easily extend Echo UI's component library.

#### üõ†Ô∏è **Easy-to-use Hook**

Hook specially designed for audio interaction and analysis applications, which can easily implement audio interactive applications.

#### üìà **Responsive layout**

Echo UI's component library is responsive, meaning they can automatically adapt to different screen sizes, providing a good experience on different devices.
